dAmn Viper - dAmn API in Python
===============================
**dAmn Viper** is a Python package created by
`photofroggy <http://photofroggy.deviantart.com>`_.

The package provides an API for connecting to, and interacting with,
dAmn, deviantART's chatrooms. dAmn Viper uses **twisted** to manage the
connection, and was made using **Python 2.7**, so it is recommended
that both of those are used when making or using applications that use
dAmn Viper.
