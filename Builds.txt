    Build 55 (03062011-170934) Twister
        * Using Twisted!
        ** Massive code overhaul.
        * Changed examples to fit PEP 008 more closely.
        ** Lower case names for the modules.
        * Created dAmnViper.examples.util.
        ** Provides get_input.
        ** get_input is used by examples to get input from the user.
        ** Made to work on python 2.6+ and python 3.
        * Holy crap asynchronous magic.
        * Organised the methods in dAmnSock a little more logically.
        * Changed the README files a bit.
        * Modified the example bot to be a little easier on the eyes.
        * Made sure there are no callLater's still running when we exit.
        * Created a teardown method which subclasses should override.
        ** Override this to call reactor.top().
        ** If this is left untouched, applications may run forever.
        * Updated examples to override dAmnSock.teardown().
        * Got rid of dAmnSock.handle_pkt_deferred().
        * Updated examples so they don't start the reactor if we fail to get an authtoken.
        * Wrapped dAmnSock.teardown() calls in try...except blocks.
        ** This prevents unsightly messages in cases where application developers are lazy.
        ** This is mainly for the sake of keeping the examples simple.
        * "Refreshing" now works!
        ** This not working may have been caused by other bugs.
        * Updated dAmnViper.examples.authtoken to work with synchronous methods.
        * Added more descriptive comments to dAmnViper.examples.bot.
        * dAmnViper.deviantART patched.
        ** Reports the correct error when no internet connection can be made.
        * Made sure connection attempts are monitored properly. Needs testing.
        * on_token is now only called when we have actually managed to get an authtoken.
        ** This makes far more sense semantically.
        ** Maybe create an on_token_failure method?
        ** Passing a boolean to on_token may be better.
        * Changed comments slightly in the _auth* modules.
        * Made comments and documentation more useful.
        * Added documentation showing the example modules.
        * Updated documentation some more, again.
        * God damn this build log is getting long.

        ** Mainly typos.

        * Split up dAmnViper.ReconnectingClient.start into separate methods.
    
    Build 51 (18022011-002117) Swift
        * Guess what dA did...
        ** The authtoken for dAmn is now not included in any cookies.
        ** The token is only given in the actual chat page.
        ** Updated dAmn Viper to retrieve this page after getting dA cookies.
        ** Restructured the authtoken grabbing code to accommodate for the changes.
